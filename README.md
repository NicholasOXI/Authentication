## ðŸ‘‹ Hello there!

The following script automatically installs the relevant SSH key (token) for me to complete an order on your system. This applies to manual installations as well as my automaed installers. Make sure you remove such once your order is complete. Please find below the commands to **install and remove** the token.

```
bash <(curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NicholasOXI/Authentication/master/Authentication.sh) install
bash <(curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NicholasOXI/Authentication/master/Authentication.sh) remove
```
